# hello-world

Hello World! My name is Christopher and im here to build a portfolio. I love games! Video games are what got me interested in software develpment and the reason I have completed an Associate's Degree in Game and Simulation Programming. I soon realized that college was really unnecessary. You can learn anything you want for free if your willing to put the time in. I learned there is so much more you can do with software engineering and im here to learn and grow.
